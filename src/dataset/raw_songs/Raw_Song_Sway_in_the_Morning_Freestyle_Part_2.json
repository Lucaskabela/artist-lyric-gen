I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo\nThen spread slugs\nMy brain matter\nIs a brain fatter\nSee my vision\nOr my vision'll stare at ya\nThis is the future if I say so\nYall copping fitted caps\nI'm about to go and cop a halo\nThe God of rap and I mean it\nI play kickball with Mars\nAnd marbles with Pluto and Venus\nWitness the genius\nI interact with the inner city villains\nThat are into your circle\nLike a computer hack\nThen give you that (Haha)"}
