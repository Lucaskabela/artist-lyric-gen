Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick\nFuck the stage name that-the name that I was given\nThe only thing that I can identify with within this business\nJust a good kid from Compton that wanna rap\nWeighin' my options, pick up a bible or a strap\nI never killed a man, I never sold any crack\nAll I ever did was try to keep my city on the map\nBut, this monkey on my back: y'all don't want me to win\nI'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends\nSo, just to get a dollar, would I sell my soul?\nI look the Devil in the eye, and tell him, \"Hell, no\"\nThey say \"Anything worth having is worth the wait\"\nBut I want the world tell me how long that takes\nIt's no time like now\nI could cut my patience short or give 'em some more gowns\nI don't even want the crown, I just want the peace of mind\nAnd nigga, when I get it, you won't get a piece of mine\nWon't you mind your own business!\nA rich nigga buy anything you sell 'em\nA broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em\nWell, I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga (Tuh!)"}
