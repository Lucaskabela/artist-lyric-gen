What are your city plans for?\nAre you a accident? Are you just in the way?\nYour native tongue contradictin' what your body language say\nAre you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?\nAre you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?\nBecause the king don't cry, king don't die\nKing don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall\nKingdom come, when I come, you know why\nKING! KING! KING! KING! KING!\nI am T'Challa"}
