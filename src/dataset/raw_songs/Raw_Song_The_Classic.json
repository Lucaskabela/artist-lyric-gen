{"title": "The Classic", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "lyrics": "From the very heart of me\nBelief becomes action\nAnd no distractions will take my eyes off the prize\nGreatness is my goal\nBut there's failure on the way\nFull of insecurity, self-hate and doubt\nBut what I can't control can't confine me\nAnd what I can't do can't stop me\nThis is how I express myself\nNot how I follow others expectations\nBut how I stay true"}
