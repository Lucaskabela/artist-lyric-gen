Shot what?\nYou ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump\nWho you motherfuckers want?\nLeave a motherfucker slump, from the fuckin' pump\nHe's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk\nMight be [?] in Houston\nLean in my pimp cup\nRidin' 84's, throw like a [?] pot\nHoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL\nAnd I know black choppers on the rooftop\nFlip a nigga like he was a NBA mascott\nStrip a nigga from his wavecap to his [?]\nGot it from my grandpop, was raised on them Compton blocks\nEvery day caught the fade, like we on the barbershop\nGoons in the parkin' lot\nOoh you's a fool if you bark a lot, with no bite\nLike [?] kill right\nIn front of your momma\nHold tight [?]\nSummertime, perfect for duck hunting\nAnd your women wanna be in my house\nWith her ass out, she climax then pass out\nLike promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest\nEat ten rappers a day, now that's a hell of a diet\n\n[Chorus]\nYour girlfriend she all on me\nSay she wanna clean my dirty laundry\nSay she wanna clean my dirty laundry\nBitch I'm K Dot and I'm keepin' it friendly\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got this, jumpin' like a kangaroo\nPumpin' like a fist [?]\nFrom the pro black, this is automatic rap\nHave a seat, grab a snack, we gon' be here for a second\nArmageddon might be here, when I finish pray the Heaven has a home\nI'm alone in my own galaxy\nYou'll never have a headstart with a dead battery\nAnd they screamin' agony, when I write shit\nMy life is, filled with excitin'\nVisions of a nigga making mills with a strikin'\nImpact for ten years, I've been here before\nSee this is all premature\nI start the war like an instigator\nChopper, they some cream gaters\nOn a thursday, mix the Vodka with the Sprite\nBetter yet, roll the dice, watch me come up\nHe want to [?] with me, he cool, put your gun up"}
