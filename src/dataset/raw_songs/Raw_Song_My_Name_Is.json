Dot\nMy mother had named me Kendrick\nFuck a stage name\nThat's the name that I was given\nThe only thing that I can identify with in this business\nI'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap\nWeighing my options pick up a bible or strap\nI never kill'd a man\nNever sold any crack\nAll I ever did was try to keep my city on the map\nPut Smokey on my back\nY'all don't want me to win\nI'm tryna find some dreams y'all want me to follow trends"}
