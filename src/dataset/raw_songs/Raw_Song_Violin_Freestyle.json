{"title": "Violin Freestyle", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "lyrics": "[Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm on Union Square\nKendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there\nMe and my man, no one compare\nThat's like two left shoes, you fools\nI'm so rude, my flow is so crude\nSpit at the mouth, foam and drool\nI'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal\nLooking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess\nLift my flows like I flip your wife\nAnd pass it to Sounwave down the way\nYou know he's nice\nADHD, producer, recruit ya\nTo the armies ?\nTake a nigga to war\nYou know how I'm about to settle the score\nKendrick, Ramal spelled backwards\nCome and get me, you're nothing but target practice\nYou're actors, coming at you with my flows\nLike acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton\nYou get stomped on, what is you're talking about?\nYou don't want none.."}
